# Smart-Plant-
This smart plamt system uses a moisture pin to set parameeters to watr your plant. The micro controller is the new Photon 2. It has a BME to measure temp, press and humidity. Use the digital and alogue outputs to light up the night! This does reqiure using an octocuopler for acurate volts to power the pump. I have the schematic for it. Be safe!
