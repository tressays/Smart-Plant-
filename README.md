# Smart-Plant-
This smart plant system uses a moisture pin to set parameters to water your plant when it needs it without it being overwatered. The micro controller is the new Photon 2. It has a BME to measure temp, press and humidity. Use the digital and alogue outputs to light up the night! This does reqiure using an octocuopler for acurate volts to power the pump. I have the schematic for it. Be safe!
